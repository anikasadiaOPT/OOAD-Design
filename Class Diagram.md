## 🧠 What is a Class?

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects that share:

- 🏷️ Similar **properties** (also called **attributes**)
- ⚙️ Common **behavior** (also known as **operations** or **methods**)
- 🔗 Common **relationships** to other objects
- 💡 Common **semantics** (meaning within the system)

### 💡 Examples:
- **Student**
- **Employee**

Each class is a template for creating individual objects (instances).
