## 🧠 What is a Class?

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects that share:

- 🏷️ Similar **properties** (also called **attributes**)
- ⚙️ Common **behavior** (also known as **operations** or **methods**)
- 🔗 Common **relationships** to other objects
- 💡 Common **semantics** (meaning within the system)

### 💡 Examples:
- **Student**
- **Employee**

Each class is a template for creating individual objects (instances).

## 🌟 Class Diagram Representation

A **Class Diagram** represents the structure of a system by showing:

- 🧱 **Classes** — The blueprint of objects, including attributes and operations.
- 🧩 **Component Parts** — Attributes (data members) and operations (methods) that define class behavior.
- 🔗 **Relationships Between Classes** — Such as association, aggregation, composition, inheritance, and realization.

> It is a foundational diagram in Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD), helping visualize how different classes interact within the system.
